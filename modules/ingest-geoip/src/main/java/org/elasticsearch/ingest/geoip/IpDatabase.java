     * This class has two related methods, getResponse and a method getTypedResponse. These are identical except that getTypedResponse's
     * generic type is constrained to extend the Response interface. The getResponse method is abstract. The default implementation of
     * getTypedResponse delegates to getResponse and that is the only place in the codebase that getResponse is called: everywhere else
     * calls getTypedResponse (as of ES 9.1.0). Implementing classes therefore have a choice: they can implement getResponse; or they can
     * override the implementation of getTypedResponse, and make getResponse throw since it will now never be called.
     *
     * (The getResponse method only exists because there are implementations of this interface outside of this codebase which haven't yet
     * been converted to implement getTypedResponse instead.)
